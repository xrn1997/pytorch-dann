%CALL: [AP_grid_set]=Fct_convertdatapergrid_toAPwise_inpNAP(Data_per_gridpoint,N_AP);
%purpose: convert the fingerprint data Data_per_gridpoint, which is given per grid point, into data per
%Access Point
%INPUTS
%Data_per_gridpoint  = a Nmeas x 2 cell with Nmeas= number of measurements;
%                      the elements Data_per_gridpoint{i,1}, i=1:Nmeas show
%                      the (x,y,z) coordinates (in meters) where a measurement is done
%                      and the  elements Data_per_gridpoint{i,2}, i=1:Nmeas
%                      show the access points and the RSS values heard in
%                      that measurement point. For example, if in the point 
%                      (1, 2, 0) wer hear the access points 7 and 10 at -70 dB 
%                      and -65 dB respectively, then
%                      Data_per_gridpoint{i,1}=[1 2 0]; and
%                      Data_per_gridpoint{i,2}=[ 7   10;
%                                               -70  -65];
%N_AP                =total number of access points heard in the fingerprinting dataset 
%                     Data_per_gridpoint
%OUTPUTS
%AP_grid_set         = a N_AP x1 cell which contains the same information
%                    as the Data_per_gridpoint but written in a different
%                    form; each element AP_grid_set{i} contains a M_i x 4
%                    matrix, with M_i=number of points where the i-th AP is
%                    heard. For example if AP number 7 is heard in the
%                    point ( 1 2 0) (in meters) at level -70 and in the
%                    point (2 2 5) at level -90, then 
%                    AP_grid_set{7}=[1 2 0 -70;
%                                    2 2 5  -90];
