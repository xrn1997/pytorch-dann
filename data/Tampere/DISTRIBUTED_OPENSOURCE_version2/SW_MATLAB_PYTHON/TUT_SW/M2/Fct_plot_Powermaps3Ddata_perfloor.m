%CALL: [qx,qy,qz, Length_WiFigrid,plot_index]=Fct_plot_Powermaps3Ddata_perfloor(index_AP,FingerprintData_perAP, desired_floor_height)
%INPUTS:
%index_AP= the Access Point index for which we want to plot the power map;
%          it should be scalar between 1 and N_AP with
%          N_AP=length(FingerprintData_perAP) = number of AP in the
%          database
%FingerprintData_perAP  =  a cell ofsize 1x N_AP; each cell element i (i=1:N_AP) contains 
%                          4 values:  (x,y,z, RSS_dB) 
%                          with (x,y,z)=the coordinates of the measurements
%                          and RSS_dB= the measured  RSS value in decibel
%                          from the i-th AP to the (x,y,z) point
%desired_floor_height = height of the floor at which we plot the data; if
%                       the value is not found in the FingerprintData_perAP
%                       nothing will be plotted
%OUTPUTS (optionals)
%[qx,qy,qz]           = the 3D mesh which is plotted as the power map  
%Length_WiFigrid      = the number of points in which the considered AP is
%                       heard
%plot_index           = a 0 or 1 flag telling if a power map is plotted or
%                     not; in our case a power map is plotted only if the
%                     considered AP is heard in more than Minimum_number_points_for_plot 
%                     points at the
%                     considered floor
